#Right now the Cisco functions work properly.
#I believe the Juniper functions work but I am unable to verify. I believe I have an old off the wall model to test with, 
#it is an Firewall SRX-210POE. It is No longer supported version by juniper so I cannot verify as of yet. 
#I want to test with a normal Juniper Switch or Router.

#Please if you can test with a normal Router or Switch please run this program and tell me if the Juniper Function works or not with your equipment.

#I cannot test the HP model section I have no equipment todo so right now. This is just for the future.
